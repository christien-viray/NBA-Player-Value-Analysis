NBA Player Value Analysis
Author: Christien Viray


This project analyzes the value of NBA players based on their performance stats and salary during the 2023-2024 season. Using Python and Excel, I explored metrics like Player Efficiency Rating (PER), games played, minutes played, and PER per million dollars to determine which players give the most value to their teams.


Summary
- Cleaned and analyzed NBA data using Python.
- Created visualizations and a summary table in Python and Excel.
- Key metric: PER per million (how efficient a player is relative to their salary).
- Top value players identified: Austin Reaves and Desmond Bane.


Files Included
- 'main.ipynb': Python script with cleaning, filtering, and visualizations.
- 'nba_valuablePlayers_summaryTable.xlsx': Excel file with summary table and visualization.
- 'cleaned_pergame_and_advance_2023_w_salaries.csv': Original dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/albarpambagio/nba-player-    stats-and-salaries-2014-2023?resource=download
- 'nba_valuablePlayers_cleaned.csv': File exported from Python after cleaning, filtering, and visualizations
- 'visuals': folder containing visualizations from Excel and Python


Libraries Used
- pandas
- matplotlib.pyplot
- seaborn


Visuals
- Summary Chart: visuals/Excel Visuals
- Python Charts: visuals/Python Visuals


How to Run
1. Install required libraries using pip (if not already installed):
	pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
2. Open main.ipynb file in VS Code
3. Run each cell from top to bottom to clean, filter, generate visualizations, and export csv file


Notes
- Value is subjective â€” it depends on team goals (e.g., budget, role needs).
- Reaves and Bane offer different kinds of value: 
	- Reaves: Cost-efficient, solid performance 

	- Bane: High quality performance, higher salary.
